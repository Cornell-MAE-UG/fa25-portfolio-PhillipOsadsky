For a class, we were asked to design and sketch a mechanism of dimensions 150cm x 50cm to lift a load of maximum weight and a maximum height. We are given a bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports two of which are on the ground, and a linear actuator of our choice from an online catalog using the maximum force values. I ended up sketching a diagram and calculating the force using moment equilibrium and the respective angles with the top and bottom of the bar. Using geometric principles, I found the appropriate values in order to maximize weight and height of the bar.
