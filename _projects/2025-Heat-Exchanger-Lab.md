As part of a class project, we selected a real-world instance of a device or system that we have learned about in Thermodynamics, explained how it works in detail, and then discussed how its performance would change under change in design or operating conditions. 

The supplies for this activity are:
• one heat exchanger
• two water pumps
• 4 water buckets
• ice
• water
• styrofoam for insulation
• an immersion heater
• one thermocouple
• four thermometers
• food dye

The four ports of the heat exchanger are labeled – 1 flows to 2 (and visa versa), and 3 flows to 4 (and visa versa). We used the bucket with the attached immersion heater as the hot water source and placed a pump inside. We used the bucket with the Styrofoam insulation as the cold water source and placde a pump inside. We seet and measured the temperature of these two reservoirs. We started with these reservoirs completely full to maximize our run time. We directed the tubes from the other two heat reservoir ports into the other two buckets. We set up thermometers in each of the reservoirs. We turned on the power to the pumps (shown to the right) using the power strip.

We considered changing and monitoring the effect of the operation of the exchanger in parallel flow vs counter flow.

Parallel: We found the initial temperature of the water in the cold reservoir to be 6 degrees Celsius and the warm reservoir to be 40 degrees Celsius. The initial temperature of the exchanger was 20.7 degrees Celsius. During the process the exchanger was at 20 degrees. The temperature of the water from the cold reservoir after going through the exchanger was 20.5 degrees and the water from the warm reservoir was 23.8 degrees.

Counter-flow: We found the initial temperature of the water in the cold reservoir to be 5 degrees Celsius and the warm reservoir to be 40 degrees Celsius. The initial temperature of the exchanger was 20.8 degrees Celsius. During the process the exchanger was at 18 degrees. The temperature of the water from the cold reservoir after going through the exchanger was 25.7 degrees and the water from the warm reservoir was 18.8 degrees.
